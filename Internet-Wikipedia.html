    <p>The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.</p>

    <h2>Why I think the Internet is amazing!</h2>
    
  <p>The Internet connects us. It's as simple as that. No matter how far from our loved ones we may be, various websites, apps, and programs allow us to stay in touch with them. For example, when I was studying abroad in Canada, my cell phone didn't get service and I was effectively cut off from my friends and family back home. Thanks to the Internet, I was still able to message and even FaceTime them. Now that I'm home, I am able to use it to stay in touch with the friends that I made while I was abroad.</p>

  <p>Whether it comes from searching for something specific or just coming across something new while scrolling through Facebook, we can come across new things at any time. These things can be concepts, ideas, or products. Sometimes, we can even find something that we have never heard of that we end up loving. For example, I posted a Tweet asking for book recommendations. I received many recommendations at least eight different people, and all of their recommendations were books that I had never heard of and that I would have been unlikely to encounter on my own. In addition, I was listening to a Podcast that I was streaming online and one of the hosts recommended a book that I had not heard of before: The Martian by Andy Weir. Being a book in the sci-fi genre, it's completely out of my normal reading realm, but I was completely hooked from the first page. Of course, we can encounter some bad things as well, but how badly we are affected by them is completely dependent on us.</p>
